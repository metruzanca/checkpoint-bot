# Caffeinator (aka Checkpoint Bot)

Little accountability bot for my discord server.

## TODO

- [ ] Integrate Goose for migrations (`schema` folder currently not being used)
  - I think I need to move the queries/schema sql files as I might need to embed the schema folder migrations
- [ ] Implement slash commands
  - [ ] Create Checkpoint
  - [ ] Get next checkpoint
  - ... more to come
- [ ] (try to) Make sure bot unregisters commands when it crashes
