## TODO

- [ ] Integrate Goose for migrations (`schema` folder currently not being used)
  - I think I need to move the queries/schema sql files as I might need to embed the schema folder migrations
- [ ] Implement slash commands
  - [ ] Create Checkpoint
  - [ ] Get next checkpoint
  - ... more to come
